# 🏡 Blockchain Land Registry System

A **decentralized land registry application** built using **Ethereum Blockchain and Solidity**.  
This project ensures **secure, transparent, and tamper-proof** land record management by eliminating the need for intermediaries.

---

## 🚀 Overview

The **Blockchain Land Registry System** provides a platform where:
- Land ownership records are stored on the blockchain.
- Every transaction is transparent and verifiable.
- Fraud and data manipulation are prevented through immutability.

---

## 🧩 Key Features

- 🔐 **Secure Storage:** Records are stored on blockchain and cannot be altered.
- 👨‍⚖️ **Ownership Verification:** Only verified users can register or transfer land.
- 📜 **Transaction Transparency:** Every action is traceable on the Ethereum network.
- ⚙️ **Smart Contracts:** Automates property registration, verification, and transfer.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Solidity** – Smart contract programming language  
- **Ethereum Blockchain** – Decentralized network  
- **Remix IDE** – For writing and testing smart contracts  
- **MetaMask** – Wallet for account and transaction handling  
- **Ganache / Hardhat (optional)** – Local blockchain development environment

## ⚙️ How to Run

1. Open [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/)
2. Upload the `Landregistry.sol` file.
3. Compile the contract using the **Solidity Compiler**.
4. Deploy it using:
   - **Injected Web3** (for MetaMask)
   - or **Remix VM (local testing)**
5. Interact with contract functions like:
   - `registerLand()`
   - `verifyOwner()`
   - `transferLand()`
   - `viewLandDetails()`

---

## 🔍 Smart Contract Functions (Example)

| Function | Description |
|-----------|--------------|
| `registerLand()` | Registers new land with details like owner, location, price |
| `verifyOwner()` | Verifies current land owner |
| `transferLand()` | Transfers ownership after verification |
| `viewLandDetails()` | Retrieves land information by ID |

---

## 📈 Future Enhancements

- Web interface using **React + Web3.js**
- IPFS integration for document storage  
- Admin dashboard for land verification
